# Stable Memory Implementation

This project implements stable memory management for user data on the Internet Computer. It uses stable structures to provide persistent storage for user profiles and facilitates data manipulation through various functions.

## Features

- **Stable Memory Management**: Utilizes `ic_stable_structures` for efficient memory management.
- **User Profiles Storage**: Implements a stable B-tree map for storing user profiles persistently.
- **Data Manipulation Functions**: Includes functions for reading and mutating state to manage user data effectively.

## Memory Management

This implementation defines a memory type for stable storage and provides functions to read and mutate the state of the user profiles.

### Key Components

- **Memory Type**: The `Memory` type is defined as a `VirtualMemory` with a `DefaultMemoryImpl`.
- **User Profiles Storage**: `UserProfiles` is a `StableBTreeMap` that stores user data persistently.

### State Structure

The `State` structure holds user profiles and potentially other types of data in the future.

```rust
pub struct State {
    pub user_profiles: UserProfiles,
    // Additional data structures can be added here
}
